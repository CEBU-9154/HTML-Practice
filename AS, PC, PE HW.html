        <h1>Even More 007n7 and c00lkidd facts! (woo)</h1>
        <p>*please take note that this is a slight recap from my first 007n7 and c00lkidd webpage :>*</p>
    </center>
    <h3>Starting with 007n7!!</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>007n7 just fed c00lkidd junk food but left veggies in it so that c00lkidd wouldn't die.</li>
        <li>007n7 wears the shirt he has on because c00lkidd thinks it's funny.</li>
        <li>007n7 is canonically retired from hacking.</li>
        <li>007n7 is c00lkidd's adoptive father.</li>
        <li>007n7 feels a pang of familiarity whenever he sees c00lkidd in the rounds.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Now, c00lkidd's turn!!</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>In Forsaken lore, c00lkidd is only 10 years old, mking him the only kid in Forsaken</li>
        <li>c00lkidd is not fully aware of what he’s doing. He believes he’s just roughhousing, and thinks everyone he
            kills is just
            taking a nap, tired from playing. He does slowly realize what happened after the round tho.</li>
        <li>c00lkidd is the only Killer that is based on an actual exploiter in Roblox, rather than a myth or urban
            legend.</li>
        <li>c00lkidd has unique lines for when he kills 007n7, his adoptive father. He also has a unique kill animation
            for him,
            where he gently lays 007n7's corpse on the ground instead of throwing him like other characters, while 007n7
            doesn't
            resist or fight back.</li>
        <li>c00lkidd likes dirt cake, which is made with crushed up cookies (preferably in a dark color), pudding, and
            gummy worms.
            The cookies represent dirt, and the gummy worms resemble live earthworms.</li>
    </ul>
